## Issues Encountered
I did a lot of research on message boxes and got confused with input boxes, which cost me some time.

However, the main issue was understanding how to format money into the necessary output, but i used ``String.Format("{0:C}", inputVariable)`` to print a dollar sign, commas, and decimals with only two leading zeroes quite efficiently.
