## Issues Encountered
File operations are really strange in VB and I wanna go home. I don't like that the StreamReader is null before reading a line and it caused some real havoc in the beginning.
Also, validating whether the file is in the proper month-savings-month-savings format is gonna be a bit tough for me, but I feel it may be necessary to fill the arrays properly.
